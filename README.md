▶ Case (i): Asymptotically stable or unstable, depending on the
signs of λ and μ.
▶ Case (ii): Asymptotically stable or unstable based on the sign
of λ.
▶ Case (iii): Asymptotically stable or unstable, with potential
for maximum/minimum trajectories.
▶ Case (iv): Saddle point, inherently unstable.
▶ Case (v): Center, neutral stability with circular orbits.
▶ Case (vi): Asymptotically stable or unstable, with spiraling
orbits.
For the details of linearised models, consider the systems du/dt = au+bv; dv/dt = cu+dv; 
we linearise nonlinear models of epidemiological problems when we want to explore further the dynamics of the systems.
